Steps to run the code
1. Download the Jupyter notebook.
2. The first cell should contain instructions for any additional module that may require installation. Terminal commands are provided in the comments
3. Run all cells. 
4. Scroll down to the "Running the Program with GUI" section
5. Follow the instructions there. 
6. For any music in the Music_database/'FILENAME.wav', you need to ask us for the wav files, which could not be uploaded here or in Devpost. Shoot us an email and we'll send you the zip.
7. When you do receive the zip file, unzip, and name the folder "Music_database" and put it in the same directory as the notebook
